# Autoclicker
Record any taps/clicks on the screen. Then, play those actions and AutoClicker will run those taps/clicks automatically in the same order, same time, and same position.

Get started by cloning the repo and building the app on your andriod device.
Then, start the AutoClicker service under "Accessibilty" in the system settings.
Finally, tap "record" and "start" to begin saving a workflow

TODO:
- Ability to change the playlist name after creation
- Confirm on delete
- Need to track these todo's better, but this is good for now

UI needs a lot of work as well
- Change "Start" button title to "recording" or "{name of playlist}"
- Change background of floating view to indicate current action performed
- Main activity list view and record button need to be styled
- Whatever else I can think of
